# piano-assignment
A simple piano implementation that plays do-re-mi sounds from the white keys to the black, and in reverse order.
Start from the first white key then play up to the last black key, or start from the last black key and play up to the first white key. Click on the keys consecutively but ignore the key labeled ;(semicolon).
Viola! You have your Do-Re-Mi lyrics.
